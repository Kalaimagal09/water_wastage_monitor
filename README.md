## 🎯 The Problem

According to NITI Aayog, 21 major Indian cities, including Chennai, are facing a critical water crisis. A significant, yet solvable, part of this problem is water wastage in shared spaces like university hostels, where taps are often left running unnoticed, wasting thousands of liters daily.

## ✨ Our Solution

**Smart Water Guardian** is an intelligent IoT ecosystem designed to tackle this problem head-on. It moves beyond simple monitoring to create a comprehensive platform that:
* **Monitors** water usage in real-time with instant alerts.
* **Engages** the community to foster a culture of conservation.
* **Predicts** and prevents leaks before they happen using AI.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

Our solution is built on two core innovations that make it highly effective:

### 🏆 Community Gamification
The "Water Savers Leaderboard" introduces a fun, competitive element among students. By gamifying conservation, we encourage long-term behavioral change and make saving water a shared community mission.

### 🧠 Predictive Maintenance with AI
Our system uses a simple machine learning model to analyze water flow patterns and detect subtle anomalies. This allows us to predict potential hardware failures and leaks, enabling proactive maintenance that saves both water and money.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

Our system follows a simple, robust, and scalable data flow:

**IoT Sensor → Cloud Platform → Data Processing & AI → Real-time Dashboard & Alerts**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used

* **UI/UX Design:** **Canva** (Chosen for rapid, high-fidelity prototyping ideal for a hackathon).
* **Conceptual Hardware:** Low-Cost Water Flow Sensors (To meet the project's affordability constraint).
* **Conceptual Backend & Cloud:** **Python on AWS** (Python for its ML libraries; AWS for its scalability and IoT services).

## 💼 Business Model: Savings-as-a-Service

We offer a risk-free partnership model for institutions. After a low one-time installation fee, we take a small percentage of the **verified savings** on the client's monthly water bill. This means **we only make money when our clients save money.**

## 🌱 Project Impact

* **Environmental:** Directly conserves a critical resource in a water-stressed region.
* **Financial:** Provides immediate and significant cost savings on utility bills.
* **Social:** Builds a lasting culture of environmental responsibility and conservation.
